# Testing exercise TDD (Test Driven Development)

-   The purpose of this task is work by the TDD practice
-   You supposed to create the following test by assuming the implementation is already done and works.

# Implement the following test

1. Create test that will import a function and will run in with the params grades [ 90, 76, 35], the function should return the average of the grades.
   for example: by giving the function the grades array we supposed the get 67

    # DO NOT IMPLEMENT THE BODY OF FUNCTION YET, just import an empty function as follow:

    - const gradesAvg = () => {

    }

2. Run the test, what's the result of the test?
3. Implement the gradesAvg function
4. Run the test, what's the result of the test now?
