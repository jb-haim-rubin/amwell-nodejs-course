# What is Promise

A Promise is an object representing the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Since most people are consumers of already-created promises, this guide will explain consumption of returned promises before explaining how to create them.

Essentially, a promise is a returned object to which you attach callbacks, instead of passing callbacks into a function. Imagine a function, createAudioFileAsync(), which asynchronously generates a sound file given a configuration record and two callback functions: one called if the audio file is successfully created, and the other called if an error occurs.

Promise Object Properties
A JavaScript Promise object can be:
The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.

-   Pending - While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
-   Fulfilled - When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
-   Rejected - When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object.
