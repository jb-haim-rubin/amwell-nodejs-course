# Why typescript?

-   TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.
-   TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.
-   TypeScript simplifies JavaScript code, making it easier to read and debug.
-   TypeScript gives us all the benefits of ES6 (ECMAScript 6), plus more productivity.
-   TypeScript can help us to avoid painful bugs that developers commonly run into when writing JavaScript by type checking the code.
