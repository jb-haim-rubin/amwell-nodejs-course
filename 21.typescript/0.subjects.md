# Typescript - subject in this folder

-   Background
-   TypeScript files extension is 'ts' for example index.ts
-   To validate TypeScript files we need to use the TypeScript package language called 'typescript'
-   Typescript / es6 / es5 ?
-   Typescript-starter - I've created a starter for you to simplify the configuration of TS you can find it here:
    https://github.com/haim-rubin/typescript-starter
    1. You can clone / download it
    2. Browse to the folder of this project and run npm i
    3. To compile run: npx tsc, then you'll see that 'build' folder was created, and inside the folder you'll see 'es5' file
    4. To watch the files while you're working on it run: npm start, this will watch the files that you're working on and apply the changes any time you click save and the code is valid
